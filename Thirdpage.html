<p>As the name suggests the ‘Control Instructions’ enable us to specify the order in which the various instructions in a program are to be executed by the computer. In other words the control instructions determine the ‘flow of control’ in a program. There are four types of control instructions in C. They are:</p>
<ol>
	<li> Sequence Control Instruction</li>
    <li>Selection or Decision Control Instruction</li>
    <li>Repetition or Loop Control Instruction</li>
    <li>Case Control Instruction</li>
</ol>
<p>The Sequence control instruction ensures that the instructions are executed in the same order in which they appear in the program. Decision and Case control instructions allow the computer to take a decision as to which instruction is to be executed next. The Loop control instruction helps computer to execute a group of statements repeatedly. In the following chapters we are going to learn these instructions in detail. Try your hand at the Exercise presented on the following pages before proceeding to the next chapter, which discusses the decision control instruction</p>
