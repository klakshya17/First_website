<p>Armed with the knowledge about the types of variables, constants & keywords the next logical step is to combine them to form instructions. However, instead of this, we would write our first C program now. Once we have done that we would see in detail the instructions that it made use of.</p>
<p>Before we begin with our first C program do remember the following rules that are applicable to all C programs:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Each instruction in a C program is written as a separate statement. Therefore a complete C program would comprise of a series of statements.</li>
	<li>The statements in a program must appear in the same order in which we wish them to be executed; unless of course the logic of the problem demands a deliberate ‘jump’ or transfer of control to a statement, which is out of sequence</li>
	<li>Blank spaces may be inserted between two words to improve the readability of the statement. However, no blank spaces are allowed within a variable, constant or keyword</li>
	<li>All statements are entered in small case letters</li>
	<li>C has no specific rules for the position at which a statement is to be written. That’s why it is often called a free-form language.</li>
	<li>Every C statement must end with a ;. Thus ; acts as a statement terminator.</li>
	<p>Let us now write down our first C program. It would simply calculate simple interest for a set of values representing principle, number of years and rate of interest.</p>
	<p>/* Calculation of simple interest */
/* Author gekay Date: 25/05/2004 */
main( )
{
int p, n ;
float r, si ;
p = 1000 ;
n = 3 ;
r = 8.5 ;
/* formula for simple interest */
si = p * n * r / 100 ;
printf ( "%f" , si ) ;</p>
</ol>
